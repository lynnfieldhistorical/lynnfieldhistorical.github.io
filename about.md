Lynnfield Historical Consulting (LHC) was originally established in 2016 with a focus on genealogy for individuals and community engagement for museums and archives. After a hiatus, LHC is revamping as a space to collect and share resources relating to history, education, and culture. We have always aimed to help you "Unlock Your Legacy," and we will continue to do so in new ways.
