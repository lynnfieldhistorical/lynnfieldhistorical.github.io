Much gratitude to Atmos Magazine for the opportunity to share my thoughts on climate change, cemeteries, and preservation. As a genealogist, cemeteries are essential to the work I do for clients. But more than that, they are meaningful cultural spaces for communities around the world. Please read, share, and comment. Does your family have a historic cemetery? Do you often visit cemeteries? Are there any interesting cemeteries in your town? Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts! {% include vw_bloc.html %}
