_I am re-working a personal research project, and I thought I might post some thoughts about my archival findings so far. Enjoy!_

While working through some primary sources recently, I came across an article in [Harper’s Weekly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper's_Weekly) that featured educational institutions for Black Americans. Of particular  interest to me was James’s Plantation Freedmen’s School in North  Carolina.

The school was named after Reverend Horace James, a minister from  Massachusetts who served as a chaplain in the Union army. In 1863,  General John G. Foster, commander of the North Carolina Department of  the [Freedmen’s Bureau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedmen%27s_Bureau), appointed Reverend James as “Superintendent of Negro Affairs for the  North Carolina District” and tasked him with maintaining the [Freedmen’s Colony of Roanoke Island](https://www.roanokefreedmenscolony.com/).

What struck me about this article in Harper’s Weekly was its  description of schooling as “the true foundation of the real social  reconstruction of the South.” Conceptualizing education as a means of  social and cultural advancement is central to my dissertation, and I am  fascinated by depictions of education in Reconstruction Era media.  Furthermore, this article features “illustrations of a number of the  most prominent of the schools at the South under the control and  direction of the [American Missionary Association of New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Missionary_Association).”  The AMA deeply influenced the development of schools for freedpeople.  The organization helped educate hundreds of former slaves, but it was  also a proponent of the Northern savior myth which completely ignored  the contributions of Blacks in the dismantling of slavery. In fact, the  article in question begins with an iteration of this myth: “When the  North gave freedom to the slaves of the South it saw the necessity of  giving them also the education which was necessary to their proper  appreciation and employment of their liberty…The North did its duty; the  schoolmaster followed the flag wherever it went…” The implication here  is that newly freed slaves needed the assistance of Union soldiers and  Northern schoolteachers to properly appreciate freedom, as if Black  Americans had not yearned for, fought for, and died for freedom since  first arriving to North America. By positioning the North as the  gracious liberator to helpless, childlike hordes of African Americans,  the work of Black abolitionists and educators is obscured.

In  light of this idea, I’m very interested in the ways that the AMA is  used to legitimize Black schools after the Civil War. Though the  AMA-related institutions featured in this Harper’s Weekly article certainly  did admirable work, I grow increasingly curious about less-recognized  methods of education among freedpeople. African Americans were learning  to read well before the AMA and the Freedmen’s Bureau were created, and  they continued to educate themselves after Reconstruction ended.  However, in so many newspaper and magazine articles of the day, sites of  learning were not recognized unless the AMA or Freedmen’s Bureau  sanctioned them. The acknowledgement of Black self-education would raise  questions about Black agency, and over the course of my dissertation  process, I hope to unravel the tensions around this agency as they were  manifested from the Reconstruction Era through the Jim Crow Era.
